            can at any time refuse the chosen method of work and change to
            another that will be more convenient for you. So we can assure you
            that our journey will be very interesting and useful for you.

            What if I forget that I have a session and will not show up?
          </h1>
          <p>
            The coach and health assistant will remind you an hour before the
            meeting that you have a session. And you will have time to prepare
            for it if you forget. If you do not show up for the session at the
            specified time, you will receive an SMS reminder. If you still do
            not show up after that, we will call you, because we will worry
            about you and want to know if maybe you need some help. So be
            prepared that you will be called if you do not show up for the
            session and do not warn about your absence. However, remember that
            we call you not to bother you, but we call you to make sure you are
            well.

            What if I can't show up to the session at the agreed time?
          </h1>
          <p>
            That is okay, it happens. You will get reminders and also I can
            check in with you. If for some reason you do not manage to join the
            chat, we can offer a different time to meet if needed. Or if
            something comes up and the time/day is no longer a good one send me
            a message here and we can try and reschedule. However, if you
            reschedule session time, please schedule at a later time due, not
            sooner.
